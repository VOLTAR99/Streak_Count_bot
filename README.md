# Streak_Count_bot
A discord custom bot for counting daily streak 
Commands add:

    !activity
    !topstreak
    !checkstreak <@mention>
    !resetstreak <@mention>  //only can be used by moderators. but the role can be coustomized also, just replace the role with the role you want.

This bot will automatically announce top 3 streak user every sunday and get refreshed every week.
The UNIQUE role will be awarded by the bot itself. You just need to give the bot the permission to manage roles.
These commands can only be used in Main channel where the streaks will be counted. Users will get notified if they use the commands on another channels.
You just need to put the your Main channel ID in genera channel Id section I have mentioned in the code.
Replace the bot token code with yours at the last line.
Replace the Anouncement channel ID where the congratulatory message will be anounced and the role will be awarded.

You can now coustomize the code as per as your requirements.
