# Streak_Count_bot
A discord custom bot for counting daily streak 
Commands add:
    !activity
    !topstreak
    !checkstreak
You just need to put the your main channel ID in genera channel Id section I have mentioned in the code.
Replace the bot token code with yours at the last line.
Replace the Anouncement channel ID where the congratulatory message will be anounced and the role will be awarded.

You can now coustomize the code as per as your requirements.
